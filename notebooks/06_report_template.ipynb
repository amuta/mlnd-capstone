    "It doesn't take long for someone to realise that people online, specially in social networks, are not so polite as we would expect when in person. The internet is such a different environment with respect to people's behavior where abuse and harassment usually happen without any meaninfull repercusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem that can negatively impact the users and the whole platform that they are using. Such behavior commonly happens in text messages and, with the scale that these platforms operate, generating and storing a large amount of data make this problem a good candidate to tackle with machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Toxic Comment Classification Challenge** (a Kaggle's Data Science competition$^1$) was a challenge proposed by Conversation Ai$^3$ where from a corpus of Wikipedia edit page comments labeled by the type of toxic behavior, if any, they contained,  the participants had to build that would better predict these classes in the given metric of the competition (AUC-ROC$^2$).\n",

This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

The training and test datasets have **159.571** and **153.164** rows respectively where each row correspond to a comment from Wikipedia’s talk page edits, and only the training have been labeled by human raters for the 8 categories of toxic behavior proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the labels, it is evident that the data is very imbalanced, with only 10% of rows beeing true in at least one class and this imbalance is even more evident when looking at some specific labels. That makes it necessary to use an apropriate evaluation metric (which was already apropriatedly defined in the challenge) and some other decisions, like stratification of samples"
